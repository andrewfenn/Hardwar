The aim is to create something new and original while staying true to the spirit of the original game.\r\n\r\n## Community\r\n\r\nA lot of the communication happens on the [forum](forum.hardwar.org) so feel free to stop by.\r\n\r\n## This isn't the original Hardwar game\r\n\r\nThis is a re-make of another game with the same name which is also called \"Hardwar\". The game is currently is pre-alpha state. There is currently no game to play.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping develop the game then please see below for build instructions.\r\n\r\n## Build prerequisites\r\n\r\nHardwar requires the following libraries be pre-installed.\r\n\r\n* Ogre3D - 1.8.0\r\n* OIS - 1.2\r\n* CMake\r\n* The Boost libraries\r\n* CEGUI\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nThe building instructions should be similar regardless of if you're on windows, osx or linux.\r\n\r\n###Linux\r\n\r\n    mkdir hardwar (git clone here)\r\n    mkdir build && cd ./build\r\n    cmake ../hardwar\r\n    make\r\n\r\n###Windows and OSX\r\n\r\nCopy the same steps as above, create your git repo and use cmake to generate either visual studio project files or xcode files for your platform.\r\n\r\nYou should then only have to open the xcode or visual studio file and compile. If that doesn't work please file bugs or pull requests.\r\n","name":"Hardwar","tagline":"An open source remake of the classic game Hardwar","google":""}
